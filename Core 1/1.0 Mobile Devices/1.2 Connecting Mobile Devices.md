## Connecting mobile devices
- **Phones and tablets**
	- Many different ways to connect
	- Each device has a different way of connecting and communicating back to your computer.
	- They are more than simply charging the battery.
- **Wired and wireless connectivity**
	- Standards and options change through the years
- **Used for synchronization, connectivity, backup, and identification.**
	- Sometimes simultaneously
	- Can be used as a way to identify if the device is really yours.


## USB

- **Universal Serial Bus**
	- High-speed wired communication
	- Used for charging and data transfers
	- USB connectors have changed and evolved over the years.
		- Ex. Micro B plug, Mini B plug, Type A, Type C
		- USB Type A plugs are more common for connecting to desktop and laptop computers.
- **Mini-USB**
	- Older standard
	- Commonly used on:
		- Cameras
		- GPS Devices
- **Micro-USB**
	- A smaller USB connection
	- Common worldwide
	- Used on older mobile devices (Android)
	- Slower charging and transmitting data than USB-C
- **Older devices may use Mini-USB**
	- Slightly larger
	- As mobile devices get smaller, the interfaces are designed to be larger


## USB-C

- **24-pin double-sided USB connector**
	- Commonly used by more modern devices
		- Newer Apple devices (since iPhone 15) have adopted USB-C
	- Used for both hosts and devices
		- Same physical style of the plug on each end of the USB-C cable (reversible)
			- It is designed to be easy to use because you can plug it in any orientation.
			- Also supports a higher speed than the older USB-style connectors.
- **Acts as a USB 2.0/3.0/3.1/4 connection**
	- Different signals can use the same connector
- **Can transmit other signals**
	- A single connector to be able to transmit data, including video, audio, and other information.
		- DisplayPort
		- HDMI
		- Thunderbolt

## Lightning connector

- **Apple proprietary**
	- 8-pin digital signals
	- Used on older iPhone and iPad devices
- **Has some advantages over Micro-USB**
	- It was designed to resolve several problems with the older USB connection standard.
	- Higher power output for phones and tablets
		- Improved charging speed
	- Can be inserted either way
	- Simpler design to be easy to use across many devices.

- The only challenge is that there are many different mobile devices made by different manufacturers, resulting in phone users having to carry different USB connector types on hand. 

## NFC
- **Near Field Communication**
	- Commonly used to transmit small amounts of data wirelessly over a limited area of connection.
- **Built into your device**
	- Phones, tablets, smartwatches, etc.
	- Often used for payment systems, transportation, identification, and/or transferring  information
- Access token, identity "card"
	- Short range with encryption support
	- Instead of walking around with an ID or an access card, you can simply use your device (phone, watch) to act as an access control.

## Bluetooth
- **High-speed communication over short distances**
	- *PAN* (Personal Area Network)
- **Commonly used to connect mobile devices**
	- Smart phones
	- Tethering
	- Headsets/ Headphones
	- Health monitors
	- Automobile and phone integration
	- Smartwatches
	- External speakers

## Hotspot / Tethering
- **Turn your phone into a WiFi hotspot**
	- Your own personal wireless router
	- Extend the cellular data network to all of your devices.
- If we simply have one device that is connected to a mobile phone, and it is the only device that's able to use that phone, it is often referred to as tethering.
- **Dependent on the phone type and provider**
	- May require additional charges and data costs
