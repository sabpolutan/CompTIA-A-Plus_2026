## Laptop Hardware
- Engineered to precise specifications
- Some laptops are easier to fix than others
- Manufacturers will have very different processes for managing and troubleshooting their particular systems.

## Laptop Batteries
- The power source. when unplugged
	- May be easily replaced or require a teardown
	- Some batteries are not designed to be replaced by the user
- Generally, there are 2 different batteries for laptops:
	- **Lithium-Ion (Li-ion)** and **Lithium-Ion polymer (LiPo)**
		- Most common
		- No "memory effect."
			- Meaning that you can charge the battery at any time. 
		- Charging the battery diminishes capacity
- Different types of battery form factors
	- Battery types and styles can vary
	- Battery technology is changing constantly

## Laptop Keyboard
- The most-used component of the laptop
	- Can be easy to replace
	- A few screws and a single ribbon cable
	- May not always be simple
- Connecting to an external keyboard
	- Not very portable, but works in a pinch

### Laptop Keys
- Some repairs might require the remove or replacement of a key cap
	- Can be a delicate procedure
- Often very fragile

## Laptop memory
- **Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module (SO-DIMM)**
	- Memory used in laptops and mobile devices
		-  Often easy to install and replace
			- However, not all laptops provide this level of modularity
- Some laptop memory is soldered to the system board
	- No upgrade available
	- Requires a full system board replacement

## Laptop storage
- Magnetic disk (for older/ traditional laptops)
	-  Traditional spinning drive platters
	- 2.5 form factors (3.5 inch for desktops)
- **SSD (Solid-state drive)**
	- All memory, no moving parts
	- Silent, fast access time, less latency
	- 2.5-inch form factors
-  **M.2 Interface**
	- Smaller form factor
	- No SATA data or power cables
	- Easy to install and replace

### Replace laptop storage
- All internal
	- Opening a cover on the back of the laptop
	- Opening the entire laptop
- Can be very modular
	- May have about two screws and the drive that slides out
- M.2 drives are easier
	- Requires one screw
	- Similar to RAM installation

### Migrating from HDD to SSD
- Moving from a spinning mechanical drive to solid-state memory
- Install an OS on the SSD
	- Move user documents between drives
	- Install any required applications
	- It can be time-consuming
- Image/ clone the HDD
	- Requires an imaging/ cloning software
		- Sometimes included with the SSD
		- Many commercial and open-source options
	- No OS Installation required
	- Move everything from one to the other
- Create an image file
	- One drive at a time
- Drive-to-drive image
	- Image directly from one drive to the other

## 802.11 wireless and Bluetooth
- Wireless network connectivity
	- Often integrated into the motherboard
- **802.11**
	- Local Area Network (LAN)
	- High speed
	- Internet access
- **Bluetooth**
	- Personal Area Network (PAN)
	- Short range
	- Connect peripherals and other nearby devices
- Installation of these modular cards are similar to the process of installing additional memory modules

## Wi-Fi Antennas
- Multiple antennas
	- 2 separate connectors: WiFi main connector and Auxiliary connector
	- Bluetooth
- Antenna wires wrap around the laptop screen

## Biometrics
- Sign in or unlock the device with a fingerprint reader or facial recognition
- Requires additional configuration in the OS
	- Hardware required for most options
- Have become relatively secure in recent years

## Near-Field Communication (NFC)
- Very short-range networking communication
- Common on mobile phones and smart watches
- Short-distance networking (often 4 cm or less)
- Also useful for authentication without typing a password
	- Hospital workstations
	- Warehouses
	- Manufacturing

## Camera/ webcam
- Video capture
	- Built-in camera and microphone
- Usually includes both audio and video
	- Specialized drivers and software
- For non-casual use:
	-  Analog or USB microphones can help
	- External HD camera and attach it to the top of laptop display
