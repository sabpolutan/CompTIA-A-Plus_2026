# CompTIA A+ Study Notes (2026)

Hello,

Welcome to my **CompTIA A+ Study Notes (2026)**!

This is where I will be storing my notes and practice questions to help me ace the CompTIA A+ Certification.

I am primarily using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (with some plugins) and [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for my studies.
Feel free to take a look at my notes if you're also preparing to earn the A+ certification!

More details to come soon~

\- Sabrina
